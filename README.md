# Overview

This repository contains simple examples to understand TensorFlow from the ground up. One dataset contains advertising expenditure across various channels and the sales achieved. This dataset is used in most examples.

The following two examples are shown:

* Linear Regression: Example `lin_reg_1` solves the problem from first principles, based on the solution to a differential equation that minimizes the cost function. Example `lin_reg_2` gives the solution using a Machine Learning approach with the use of TensorFlow.
* Neural Networks: Example `nn_python` solves the problem without using TensorFlow, with nothing more than Python, NumPy and Pandas. Example `nn_tf` gives the solution using a Machine Learning approach with the use of TensorFlow.

Example `nn_example` uses the famous [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) data. For brevity, MNIST data is not included in this repository. Download all four *.gz files from the above link and place them in `data/` folder.

Refer to `docs/` folder for some background information to understand this code.
